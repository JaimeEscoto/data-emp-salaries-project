## Description

Embark on a journey through the intricate realms of data industry salaries in this exploratory project. Utilizing Looker, I've crafted an immersive experience that unveils the nuances of compensation trends based on job titles, geographic locations, experience levels, and company attributes. With a curated collection of 10 visually compelling charts and tables, this project provides a holistic view of how diverse factors influence salaries. Dive into the data-driven narrative to gain valuable insights, whether you're a professional navigating career decisions or a business leader shaping strategic workforce plans. Welcome to the world of data salaries, where every visualization tells a story of compensation dynamics in this evolving industry.

## Project Overview

1. **Downloading the Dataset:**

- Start by downloading the dataset file to your local environment. Ensure you have access to the necessary file before proceeding with the analysis.

2. **Review of Fields and Data Types:**

- Conduct a comprehensive review of the dataset, examining fields and their respective data types. This step is crucial for understanding the structure of the data and preparing for subsequent analyses.

3. **Data Analysis using Looker:**

- Utilize Looker to perform in-depth data analysis. Create various graphs and visualizations to explore patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset. Leverage Looker's interactive features to gain valuable insights from the data.

## Data Set

- **Data Source:** [Jobs and Salaries in Data Science from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data/data).
- **Context:** Data Salaries for Data Employees

## Tools & Technologies Used

In the development and analysis of this project, the following tools and technologies have played a crucial role:

- **Google Sheets:**

- **Looker:**

## Plots and Analysis

1. **Scatter Plot of Flipper Length vs Body Mass**

   - This plot poses a challenge for analysis as the species cannot be clearly differentiated.

2. **Scatter Plot with Species Color Coding**

   - The ability to distinguish that Gentoo species are larger is achievable.
